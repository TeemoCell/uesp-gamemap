## last week

final polish and bugfixing before release

## polish
- added ability to shift click other locations while editing existing ones to jump to editing them
>> if unsaved changes on the current one, will warn you first
- added double click to edit on locs
- made middle click on article button open in new tab
- middle click on location/world list items opens them in new tab too
- make max zoom of all locations -0.5 on all locations client side
- fix pip on layer switcher being disconnected
- made centre on check world param (so world=stormhaven&centeron=blackwood fails, as expected)
- adjusted SR's cell resource colours to be similar to that of an actual heatmap
- added loading in cell resource state from url
- cached cell resource state in mapState (so toggling grid on/off doesnt cause resources to reload)
- added loading bar when getting cell resources from server

## bug fixes
- fixed tooltips getting in the way when dragging markers
- fixed worlds still having the "editing" tag added after cancelling (going back into worlds was showing edit menu)
- fixed opening colour picker on blobs with null colours setting the colour to a bright blue
- fixed popups getting in the way when editing worlds
- fixed pressing esc bugging out dialogs
- fixed editing worlds not locking the map properly
- fix edit templates not showing up for adding new locations
- fixed performance issues in world dropdown list
- fixed an issue where the map would zoom all the way when going up from a bigger map than the parent
- fixed map position changing/animating when switching maps (it looked cool but was a bug)
- fixed rare issue where some locs wouldnt appear when centering on them
- fixed small issue where the map would move when changing layers near the bounds of the map
- fixed links on gamemap.uesp.net help dialog still being garbled up
- fixed save button displaying wonky on save
- fixed reverted locations duplicating on the map after map move
- fixed current layer not syncing up with the current world when switching between layers
- fixed grid disappearing on resize

## todo

- make redrawing grid better
- fix canvas grid layer being laggy af on firefox when zooming out
- fix darker blocks in grid for sr going off by one at the ends

-  make sure the new maps can handle "old" style map links as best as possible, especially for ESO, for example:
https://esomap.uesp.net/esomap.html?world=246&x=394043&y=580689&zoom=11


https://gamemap.uesp.net/eso/?world=246&x=394043&y=580689&zoom=11

the latter as I'm doing right now
For all maps, I'd check if the zoom level was greater than the allowed range. If it was I'd transform it down to the 0-based zoom level.
For ESO map, I'd check if the coordinates were greater than 1 and if so divide both by 1,000,000

Note: If you try to load a map that doesn't exist it just says "Loading world...." forever.
Would be nice if it errors out or something.

- Also just noticed: If I add a new location, then un-check the "Use Name as Wiki," but the name of the wiki is similar, so I type in the name into the wiki block, the toggle auto re-checks, so I can't edit it. For example, I'm adding a book, "The Impresario's Catalogue" to the Impresario's site in Vvardenfell. The name of the wiki for this book is "The Impresario's Catalogue (book)", so, as soon as I type (or copy and paste) "The Impresario's Catalogue" into the wiki block, intending to add " (book)" to the end, the wiki toggle auto re-checks, so I can't edit it. I have to turn the toggle off, type something completely different, then edit it to the real entry "The Impresario's Catalogue (book)".  I hope my rambling made sense.
