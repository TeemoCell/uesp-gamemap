## last week:

- finished RC, fixed some bugs

## stuff:


- fixed RC refreshing each time you opened it



## stuff for dave:
- dcsg asked for dawnstar maps (give tiles)
- 1 tile per pixel
- show image that shows how they are laid out
- might have to set up old map for editing
- the maps are quite small (20px) - upscale or just use one tile?
- use normalised scheme, 1 area per world
- also get dscg editing perms
- would also allow a safe place to mess around with editing


- dawnstar (ds) map for testing
>> probably using normalised coords?
>> 1 tile per pixel
- better getMapList() api for gamemap,php (db, name, isofficial/modded)
- dcsg asked for map editing perms ("they're stingy about giving away editing rights for whatever reason IIRC")


- people asked to separate modded maps from official ones, would probably need help on the php
