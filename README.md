# UESP Gamemap

The UESP Gamemap is a custom built, Google Maps alternative for the Unofficial Elder Scrolls Pages (www.uesp.net). It was specifically designed for showing Elder Scrolls maps, but it can be modified to use other game maps if desired.

Under the hood, it uses a modified version of Leaflet, with some custom plugins.

## Vality

Vality is an in-development overhaul of the map system, focusing on usability and performance. It is named after Vality7, the modder that overhauled the Morrowind mod Project Tamriel's heightmap.
